Game of Thrones(GoT) is a cultural phenomenon. Its mix of intricately
woven fantasy, feature film level production and kinky sex have made
it a groundbreaking masterpiece. It's impact is huge. Dubrovnik, a
central shooting location in the series, has become so popular that it
has turn tourists away to avoid overcrowding. Arya, the name of a
wonderful angry teenage assassin from the series has become one of the
most popular names for baby girls in the UK[^1]. It's one of the
highest rated and most popular shows of all time. The last season of
GoT is about to air and HBO are missing a trick. A billion dollar
trick. Show the final episode in the cinema and they have a box office
hit on their hands.

Let's be clear, GoT is huge. How huge? Well episode six of season 7
was illegally downloaded 184 million times[^2]. Let's assume that
resulted in around 250 million views. That dwarfs viewership numbers
for The Super Bowl and last year's football World Cup Final. Fans have
been following the show for 8 years and dozens of narratives are
culminating in the last season - fans are invested, more so than other
shows. The cinema would be the perfect place to watch the last episode.

Illegal downloaders can be seen as leeches but they are an untapped
asset. They can be monetised in differnt ways. We're looking at
worldwide box office revenues of over \$1bn if 30% of illegal viewers
and a small proportion of paying customers bought a ticket. HBO
announced operating income of \$1.9bn[^3] in 2018 - a billion dollars
is highly material. The show isn't a complete stranger to the big
screen - two episodes from an earlier season were remastered for
IMAX. [^4]

What's stopping HBO? A lack of imagination? A lack of nerve? HBO
doesn't have ads, except ads for other HBO movies and shows. Do they
believe a cinema showing would alienate subcribers and undermine their
subscriber model? Well Roma, the academy award winning Netflix feature
film was screened in theatres and on their platform simultaneously and
I haven't come across a single Netflix user who was pissed off at this
move, so I don't think this would be an issue.

We're in the Golden Age of Television[^5], we're in the era of a
superfan and online piracy keeps growing. Studios, take advantage of
these trends, make your fans happy and and show your finales in movie
theatres.

I like to work with Node, Mongo/Postgres, Linux\n(Ubuntu), AWS, Webpack, Bootstrap, Gulp.js, React.js, Gatsby.js. I write in VS\nCode and Emacs. I’ve played around with Golang, Clojure, Haskell and Scala. I\nlike to find elegant functional programming solutions (with immutable data\nstructures) where possible.</p>\n<p>Design. I am comfortable designing and building dashboards with very little\nguidance. I have built complex systems using React Data Grid and Material-UI\nrecently.</p>\n<p>Business. I have a background in Finance and I provide business advice to small\nstartups. I qualified as an accountant at PwC specialising in Private Equity and\nInvestment Management. I worked in an investment bank in the Complex Foreign\nExchange and Interest Swaps valuation team.</p>\n<p>I really enjoy making art using Processing, Quil and p5.js. I’m learning how to\nwrite GLSL pixel shaders next.</p>\n<p>I’ve taken multiple online courses in Computer Science, Data Science, Software\nEngineering and Machine Learning. I attended the Recurse Center in NYC in 2013\nand it was instrumental in making me the programmer I am today. It’s the best\nprogrammer community I’ve come across.</p>\n<p>I like to work in small flexible teams that strive to write elegant code. I’m\nalso interested in meditation, yoga, reading, stand-up comedy, cooking and\nlearning. If I’m not learning, I’m not happy.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"About me","date":null,"description":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/pages/about/"}}

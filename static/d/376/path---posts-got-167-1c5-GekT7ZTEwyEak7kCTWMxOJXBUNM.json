Its mix of intricately woven fantasy, feature film level production and kinky sex have etched the imaginary land of Westeros in the minds of a generation. Its impact is huge. Dubrovnik, a central shooting location in the series, has become so popular that it has turn tourists away to avoid overcrowding. Arya, the name of a wonderful angry teenage assassin from the series has become one of the most popular names for baby girls in the UK <sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup>. It’s one of the highest rated and most popular shows of all time. The last season of GoT is about to air and HBO are missing a trick. A billion dollar trick. Show the final episode in the cinema and they have a box office hit on their hands.</p>\n<p>Let’s be clear, GoT is huge. How huge? Well episode six of season 7 was illegally downloaded 184 million times <sup id=\"fnref-2\"><a href=\"#fn-2\" class=\"footnote-ref\">2</a></sup>. Let’s assume that resulted in around 250 million views. That dwarfs viewership numbers for The Super Bowl and last year’s football World Cup Final. Fans have been following the show for 8 years and dozens of narratives are culminating in the last season - fans are invested in GoT more so than other shows. The cinema would be the perfect place to watch the last episode.</p>\n<p>Illegal downloaders are seen as leeches but they are an untapped asset that can be monetised. We’re looking at worldwide box office revenues of over $1bn if 30% of illegal viewers and a small proportion of paying customers bought a ticket. HBO announced operating income of $1.9bn <sup id=\"fnref-3\"><a href=\"#fn-3\" class=\"footnote-ref\">3</a></sup> in 2018 - a billion dollars is highly material. The show isn’t a complete stranger to the big screen - two episodes from an earlier season were remastered for IMAX. <sup id=\"fnref-4\"><a href=\"#fn-4\" class=\"footnote-ref\">4</a></sup></p>\n<p>What’s stopping HBO? A lack of imagination? A lack of nerve? HBO don’t show ads, except ads for other HBO movies and shows. Do they believe a cinema showing would alienate subscribers and undermine their subscriber model? Well Netflix screened the academy award winning Roma in theatres and on their platform simultaneously and I haven’t come across a single Netflix user who complained, so I don’t think this would be an issue. Perhaps a cinema screening would violate licensee contracts, but considering the largest licensee is paying £55m per annum <sup id=\"fnref-5\"><a href=\"#fn-5\" class=\"footnote-ref\">5</a></sup> for ALL HBO shows, negotiating a one off penalty makes sense.</p>\n<p>We’re in the Golden Age of Television <sup id=\"fnref-6\"><a href=\"#fn-6\" class=\"footnote-ref\">6</a></sup>, we’re in the era of a superfan and online piracy keeps growing. Studios, take advantage of these trends, make your fans happy and and show your finales in movie theatres.</p>\n<p><sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup> <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-45031042\">https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-45031042</a></p>\n<p><sup id=\"fnref-2\"><a href=\"#fn-2\" class=\"footnote-ref\">2</a></sup> <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.de/game-of-thrones-season-7-pirated-1-billion-times-torrents-streaming-muso-2017-9?r=US&#x26;IR=T\">https://www.businessinsider.de/game-of-thrones-season-7-pirated-1-billion-times-torrents-streaming-muso-2017-9?r=US&#x26;IR=T</a></p>\n<p><sup id=\"fnref-3\"><a href=\"#fn-3\" class=\"footnote-ref\">3</a></sup> <a href=\"https://variety.com/2018/film/news/time-warner-earnings-q4-2017-hbo-mlb-1202683972/\">https://variety.com/2018/film/news/time-warner-earnings-q4-2017-hbo-mlb-1202683972/</a></p>\n<p><sup id=\"fnref-4\"><a href=\"#fn-4\" class=\"footnote-ref\">4</a></sup> <a href=\"http://www.startribune.com/game-of-thrones-becomes-first-tv-series-screened-in-imax/287649051/\">http://www.startribune.com/game-of-thrones-becomes-first-tv-series-screened-in-imax/287649051/</a></p>\n<p><sup id=\"fnref-5\"><a href=\"#fn-5\" class=\"footnote-ref\">5</a></sup> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/jan/30/bskyb-five-year-deal-exclusive-rights-hbo-tv-catalogue\">https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/jan/30/bskyb-five-year-deal-exclusive-rights-hbo-tv-catalogue</a></p>\n<p><sup id=\"fnref-6\"><a href=\"#fn-6\" class=\"footnote-ref\">6</a></sup> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Age_of_Television_(2000s-present\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden<em>Age</em>of<em>Television</em>(2000s-present</a>)</p>","fields":{"slug":"/posts/got/","tagSlugs":["/tag/finance/","/tag/business/"]},"frontmatter":{"date":"2019-03-12T14:34:28.131Z","description":"A way for TV studios to monetise their pirate super fans","tags":["Finance","Business"],"title":"HBO Leave a Billion Dollars on the Table"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/posts/got/"}}
